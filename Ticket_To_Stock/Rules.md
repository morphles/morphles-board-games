# Ticket To Stock!

## Premise / End game scoring
Players play as investors into “Transportation Companies”, which themselves play by rules close to regular Ticket To Ride. At the end of the game, the player having the most value in owned shares wins.

## Setup
1. Place the board in the middle of the table.
2. Place 10 random route tickets face up by the board, if using TTR Europe, make two of them long route tickets.
3. Prepare the train card deck: 5 locomotives, and 6 cards of each color/symbol. Shuffle.
4. Create a designated companies area, and within it an area for each company – representing certain train piece color. For each company, place all their train pieces in its company area. Give each company 1 locomotive card (NOT from the prepared train card deck, but from the remaining cards!). Randomly give each company one additional card of some color from the prepared deck (NOT locomotive; if you pull a locomotive, shuffle it back into the deck).
5. Flip 5 cards from the card deck face up to create the bidding pool.
6. Give each player 1 train piece of each color – these are the starting shares the player has.
7. Prepare the company action counter area, designate the “active counters” area and the “used counters” area. Use the “Summary card” to hold the “active counters,” and the area beside it to hold the “used counters.” Place two train pieces of each color on the “active counters area,” indicating the company has two actions per company round.
8. Score trackers track company value (which is mostly TTR scoring). Set all score trackers at the appropriate score/value (1 for each train card a company has + any bonuses from the TTR version, i.e., for Europe, 9 points for each currently unused station, so in that case, it would be 11).

## Game-play
### Players actions
During their turn, a player can do two actions, both optional, but in this order:
1. Trade shares
2. Act for company

#### Trading shares
A player may exchange 1 train piece from his area with 1 or 2 train pieces of some other color. The piece being returned returns to that companies train pool. If 2 pieces are taken, they must be of the same color. The number of shares in total that a player may have is limited, and the limit depends on the number of players. [45 / #Players] - 2: 22; 3: 15; 4: 11; 5: 9; 6: 8.

#### Acting for company
A player may act for a company. To do this, the company must have a counter in the “active counters” area. Additionally, the player must either have at least one share of the company he is acting for or no one has shares of that company. A player may also pass this stage and thus not move the company counter at all. If only active counters are for companies that the player can not act for, he must pass up “Act for company.”

### Company actions
When a player elects to act for a company, he may do one of these actions for the chosen company:
- Pass (in this case, only the company counter is moved out from the active area)
- Build a route / custom version action
- Bid for train card

#### Building a route / Custom version action
A company can build a route as per TTR rules, using its cards. EXCEPT train cards are NOT used up and remain for future use! After building a route, adjust the company value. First by the value of the route as per the used TTR version. Second by any open/visible tickets that might have been fulfilled. NOTE tickets are not taken for/by the company; they are not exclusive and multiple companies can fulfill tickets and thus have their valuation increased by them. Note if building a special route like a tunnel in TTR Europe, the “gambling mechanic” still applies; flip 3 cards from the deck and if the company does not have enough train cards to match the increased price, the company’s turn ends (the active counter is still used up). Instead of building a route, a company can do an alternative player action as per the TTR version (just not getting more tickets). I.E., for TTR Europe, a company can build its station, provided it can afford it (say it has to have 3 same color/locomotive cards for the third station). Also, deduct 3 points from the company value.

#### Bidding for train card
Take one of the companies’ unused train pieces from its pool and place it on one of the open train cards in the bidding pool.

### Company counter reset / Bidding resolution
If after doing an action for a company there are no more company counters in the active area, the counters are reset and bidding is resolved. Move all inactive counters back onto the active area, making them active. Resolve bids for train cards:
- If there are train cards where some company has more train pieces on it than any other company, that train card goes to the winning company for future use in route building, increase the value of the winning company by 1. Train pieces of any companies on that card return to the pools of their respective companies.
- For cards that have ties or no bids, they just remain in the bidding pool as is, with all the train pieces on them, to potentially be won in the next Bidding resolution.
- Replace any won-over cards from the deck.

### Game end / Company valuation / Scoring
The game end condition triggers when at least 3 companies have less than 5 train pieces in their pool. Continue playing till all active company counters are deactivated, resolve bidding on the last time before counting scores.
Each company value is TTR scoring for the version/map played (including any additional mechanics like Shinkansen bonus for Japan, share bonus from Pennsylvania, Alvin capture bonus, station bonus) PLUS the number of train cards the company owns.
To calculate the score/valuation for players, simply sum up “company value” * “number of shares owned of that company.” The player with the highest value wins.*
